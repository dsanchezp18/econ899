# General notes

- Programs that are developed as tax credits or subsidies to spur innovation at the federal level can be controlled through time fixed effects, however, provincial programs are more difficult to control for.

## Covariates notes

- Including average actual hours worked in the model and total actual hours worked together yields significant results for both variables. This is rather strange. 

- Wholesale sales and manufacturing sales are not relevant, I rather keep imports. 

-  Include a time trend, like Nick says. 

-  Otherwise, we can include an interaction of provinces and periods which had some sort of policy change. 

## To dos

-  ln +1 

- no controls

- defendable controls

- all controls (extended controls)

- for patents and maybe robustness checks with other dep. variables

- focus on one period that makes sense. 

- quarter level study. 

## Notes about missing data

- No data for territories 

## For writing

- In Canada patents are for the whole country, so its hard to evalute impact in a quasi experiment. But R&D tax credits, do they generate more patents? This could make sense.
    - Should review some literature on this.

- AITC also targeted movie production. these dont produce patents, argue that.

- AITC implementation date is a bit "fuzzy".
    - Investments made beginning january 2017
    - But the program was announced in 2016
    - And expenses were elegible (maybe) beginning april 2016

- Talk about how patents were separated by section code. This is valuable but should compare to studies in Canada that have done this.
    - Most use survey data.
