# General notes

- Programs that are developed as tax credits or subsidies to spur innovation at the federal level can be controlled through time fixed effects, however, provincial programs are more difficult to control for.

## Covariates notes

- Including average actual hours worked in the model and total actual hours worked together yields significant results for both variables. This is rather strange. 

- Wholesale sales and manufacturing sales are not relevant, I rather keep imports.
