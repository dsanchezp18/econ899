# [Alberta Investor Tax Credit](https://www.alberta.ca/alberta-investor-tax-credit)

-   The Alberta Investor Tax Credit (AITC) offered a 30 per cent tax credit to qualified individuals or corporations who invest in eligible Alberta small businesses doing research, development or commercialization of new technology, new products or new processes; or to those engaged in interactive digital media development, video post-production, digital animation or tourism.

-   An investor can either invest directly in an Eligible Business Corporation (EBC) or in a Venture Capital Corporation (VCC) that has successfully registered with the program. Tax credit certificates are issued on a first-come, first-served basis until the annual budget is expended. Investors can view the remaining budget available for tax credits at: www.alberta.ca/alberta-investor-tax-credit.aspx.

-   This program started in August 2016 and ended March 30th, 2020. Eliminated along Community Economic Development Corporation Tax Credit, Capital Investment Tax Credit, Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit and the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit.

# [Alberta's Innovation Employment Grant](https://www.alberta.ca/innovation-employment-grant)

-   Companies can receive a grant of up to 20% toward qualifying research and development expenditures.

-   Program status: Open as of January 1, 2021

-   The Innovation Employment Grant encourages economic growth by supporting small and medium-sized businesses that invest in research and development (R&D) with a grant worth up to 20% of qualifying expenditures. The program promotes investment and diversification by rewarding all R&D spending in Alberta, regardless of the industry, and complementing the *Job Creation Tax Cut* by focusing on small and medium-sized firms in the earlier stages of operation, when they might not yet be profitable.

-   The Innovation Employment Grant is delivered through the corporate tax system and does not follow a formal application process. Eligible corporations will be able to claim the grant when they file their annual corporate tax returns. See How to apply for more information.

-   The grant provides qualified corporations with:

    -   an 8% payment for eligible R&D spending carried out in Alberta, up to the corporation’s base level of spending.
    -   an enhanced 20% payment for eligible R&D spending that exceeds the corporation’s base spending level. A firm’s base level of spending is determined by calculating the corporation’s average qualifying R&D spending over the previous 2 years.

-   The grant provides benefits on up to \$4 million in annual R&D spending.

-   Available to corporations that undertake R&D in Alberta. The grant will phase out incrementally for firms with between \$10 million and \$50 million in taxable capital to ensure the support targets small and medium-sized companies.

-   Firms with \$50 million or more in taxable capital are not eligible for the grant. Eligible expenditures must have been incurred in Alberta after December 31, 2020 and match those that qualify for the federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentive Program.

-   To claim the Innovation Employment Grant, eligible corporations must complete and file a Schedule 29 to the Alberta Corporate Income Tax Return (AT1), in addition to the AT1 for the respective taxation year.

# [Alberta Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/corporate-income-tax-information-circular-sred-1-alberta-sred-tax-credit)

-   The Alberta SR&ED tax credit program provides a refundable tax credit to qualified corporations that incur eligible expenditures in respect of SR&ED activities carried out in Alberta after December 31, 2008. Expenditures by a partnership, trust, or individual are not eligible for this program. In Alberta legislation, SR&ED has the same meaning as it does in the Income Tax Act (Canada).

-   It was passed January 2008 and phased out in March 2020, along with the Alberta Investor Tax Credit, Community Economic Development Corporation Tax Credit, Capital Investment Tax Credit, and Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit.

-   Also part of the Corporate Income Tax.

# [Film and Television Tax Credit](https://www.alberta.ca/film-television-tax-credit)

-   Tax credit to support medium and large-scale productions filming in Alberta.

-   Probably doesn't affect IP because it's for film and television.

-   AITC also only applies to small businesses, so it's unlikely that the two would be confounded.
