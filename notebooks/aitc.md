# AITC Overview 


The Alberta Investor Tax Credit (AITC) offers a 30 per cent tax credit to qualified individuals or corporations who invest in eligible Alberta small businesses doing research, development or commercialization of new technology, new products or new processes; or to those engaged in interactive digital media development, video post-production, digital animation or tourism.

An investor can either invest directly in an Eligible Business Corporation (EBC) or in a Venture Capital Corporation (VCC) that has successfully registered with the program. Tax credit certificates are issued on a first-come, first-served basis until the annual budget is expended. Investors can view the remaining budget available for tax credits at: www.alberta.ca/alberta-investor-tax-credit.aspx.

This program started in August 2016.

- Elegible business activities:
    -   Manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease, The manufacturing of goods normally involves the creation of something (e.g., making or assembling machines, clothing, soup) or the shaping, stamping or forming of an object out of materials (e.g. making steel rails, wire nails, rubber balls, wood moulding).

## [Film and Television Tax Credit](https://www.alberta.ca/film-television-tax-credit)

- Tax credit to support medium and large-scale productions filming in Alberta.

- Probably doesn't affect IP because it's for film and television.

- AITC also only applies to small businesses, so it's unlikely that the two would be confounded.
