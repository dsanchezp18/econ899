% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    The common knowledge that the positive spillover from research efforts disincentivizes private investment in research \& development (R\&D) by private agents has led to a widespread support for fiscal incentives for R\&D expenditure. The literature has mostly found positive effects of these policies on innovation, but it is unclear whether fiscal incentives truly impact innovation outcomes. In this paper, I examine the impact of the Alberta Investor Tax Credit (AITC) on Canadian patent applications, exploiting variation from a novel administrative dataset of intellectual property products in Canada, where the tax treatment on R\&D has been recognized as one of the most generous in the world. Using two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences and event study regressions, I find that the AITC had an overall null effect on patent applications. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that fiscal incentives for R\&D expenditure are effective in promoting innovation.

% The standard result from modern economic theory which states that the positive spillover from investment in research \& development will result in private underinvestment in innovation has led to a widespread support for fiscal incentives for R\&D expenditure. While the literature has mostly found postive effects of these policies, it is unclear whether fiscal incentives impact innovation. In this paper, I examine the effect of the Alberta Investor Tax Credit (AITC) on patent applications in Canadian provinces, where the tax treatment on R\&D has been recognized as one of the most generous in the world. Using two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences and event study regressions, I find that the AITC had a null overall effect on patent applications. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that fiscal incentives for R\&D expenditure are effective in promoting innovation.
