  abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investigates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

  abstract = {A model of endogenous growth is developed in which vertical innovations, generated by a competitive research sector, constitute the underlying source of growth. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment is constant and GNP follows a random walk with drift, although under some circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular, the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also makes innovations too small.},

  abstract = {Whereas prior research has provided valuable insights into the willingness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms to engage in patenting, a comparison of the performance implications of patenting activities across small and large firms is still lacking. This gap is important because SMEs and large firms, having different resources and capabilities, might benefit from patenting activities in different ways. In particular, SMEs can be expected to benefit less from patenting activities in terms of protection against imitators than large firms. On the other hand, the propensity and ability of SMEs to license out their patents and generate additional revenue streams might be relatively higher than that of their large counterparts. This paper studies the impact of patenting on licensing, innovation, and financial performance for both SMEs and large firms, using multiple-group path analyses on a sample of 358 manufacturing firms. Contrary to expectations, this study demonstrates that not only large firms, but also SMEs benefit from patenting in terms of commercializing product innovations. Moreover, for both SMEs and large firms, such increased innovation performance in turn contributes to higher profit margins. Patenting activities also increase the ability of SMEs and large firms to license out knowledge to external parties, and this positive effect is significantly stronger for large firms. However, neither in SMEs nor in large firms, these outward licensing activities generate short-term financial benefits. Finally, the study demonstrates that patenting activities do not trigger significant cost disadvantages for either SMEs or large firms. Jointly, these findings provide unique insights in the value-generating and cost-increasing effects of patenting, suggesting that not only large firms, but also SMEs should consider patenting as a viable strategy to fully reap commercial benefits from their innovation activities. At the same time, they temper open innovation scholars’ expectations regarding the financial benefits of licensing out knowledge. Overall, these findings point to opportunities for optimizing the intellectual property management of both SMEs and large firms.},

Although patent protection is found to provide a positive premium on average in only a few industries, our results also imply that the premium varies across industries and with firm size. Patent protection also stimulates R\&D across all manufacturing industries, albeit with the magnitude of that effect varying substantially.},

  abstract = {Because of increasing levels of competition and decreasing product life cycles, a firm's ability to generate a continuous stream of innovations may be more important than ever in allowing a firm to improve profitability and maintain competitive advantage This paper investigates several issues that are central to an examination of the innovation productivity in a firm. First, the relationship between a firm's commitment to research and development and its innovative outcomes is examined. Two innovative outcomes are analyzed: (1) invention, which focuses on the development of new ideas; and (2) innovation, the development of commercially viable products or services from creative ideas. Invention is measured by the number of patents granted, and innovation is assessed by the number of new product announcements. Second, because many inventions ultimately result in marketable innovations and because patents may provide protection for new products, the relationship between patents and product announcements is also investigated. Finally, the ability of a firm to benefit from its inventions and innovations is studied by examining their separate effects on firm performance, measured as return on assets (ROA) and sales growth. Drawing from a sample of 272 firms in 35 industries over 19 years, the results from a model of simultaneous equations provided support for some of the hypotheses, but several other surprising findings were found. As expected, R\&D spending was positively related to patents. This finding is consistent with others who argue that internal research capabilities, particularly those with a strong basic research component, is key to enabling a firm to generate creative outputs. More surprising was the finding of increasing returns to scale to R\&D spending. While this contradicts much of the existing research, it is consistent with economic arguments for the advantages of scale in innovation. Also interesting is the finding that, while a significant curvilinear relationship exists between R\&D spending and product announcements, it is not the predicted inverse-U but instead a U-shaped relationship. Consistent with previous work, product announcements were found to be positively related to both performance measures. A negative relationship was found between patents and both ROA and sales growth. While these findings were unexpected, they are intriguing and call into question the value of patents as protection mechanisms. In addition, these results may be resulting from the rise of strategic patenting, where an increasing number of firms are using patents as strategic weapons. As expected, a positive relationship was found between patents and new product announcements.},

  abstract = {On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the most sweeping revision of US tax law since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The law introduced many  significant changes. However, perhaps none was as important as the changes in the treatment of traditional "C" corporations—those corporations subject to a separate corporate income tax.  Beginning in 2018, the federal corporate tax rate fell from 35 percent to 21 percent, some investment qualified for immediate deduction as an expense, and multinational corporations faced a  substantially modified treatment of their activities. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to understand its effects on resource allocation and distribution. It  compares US corporate tax rates to other countries before the 2017 tax law, and describes ways in which the US corporate sector has evolved that are especially relevant to tax policy. The  discussion then turns the main changes of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for the corporate income tax. A range of estimates suggests that the law is likely to contribute to increased US capital  investment and, through that, an increase in US wages. The magnitude of these increases is extremely difficult to predict. Indeed, the public debate about the benefits of the new corporate tax  provisions enacted (and the alternatives not adopted) has highlighted the limitations of standard approaches in distributional analysis to assigning corporate tax burdens.},

We show that there is a deadweight loss associated with level-based R\&D tax incentives that is particularly acute for large firms. For small firms it is not sizeable enough to suppress the R\&D additionality, at least not for quite a number of years after the initial tax change. Incremental R\&D tax credits do not suffer from this deadweight loss and are from that perspective preferable to level-based tax incentives.},

Policies by modern governments increasingly recognise the benefits of supporting R\&D investment. Government funding has, however, become an increasingly scarce resource in times of financial crisis and economic austerity. Hence, it is important that available funds are used and targeted effectively. This paper offers the first systematic review and critical discussion of what the R\&D literature has to say currently about the effectiveness of major public R\&D policies in increasing private R\&D investment. Public policies are considered within three categories, R\&D tax credits and direct subsidies, support of the university research system and the formation of high-skilled human capital, and support of formal R\&D cooperations across a variety of institutions. Crucially, the large body of more recent literature observes a shift away from the earlier findings that public subsidies often crowd-out private R\&D to finding that subsidies typically stimulate private R\&D. Tax credits are also much more unanimously than previously found to have positive effects. University research, high-skilled human capital, and R\&D cooperation also typically increase private R\&D. Recent work indicates that accounting for non-linearities is one area of research that may refine existing results.},

  abstract = {On sait que le rendement industriel est influencé par les investissements en recherche et développement. En conséquence, les pays occidentaux industralisés, dont le Canada, cherchent à stimuler les dépenses de recherche et de développement par le moyen d'incitations fiscales offertes à l'industrie. L'auteur de cet article a voulu évaluer les effets directs et indirects des incitations fiscales sur les dépenses de recherche et de développement au moyen d'une étude économétrique de la production et des investissements d'entreprises canadiennes. Les résultats montrent qu'en l'absence de croissance économique, le crédit d'impôt pour investissements de recherche et de développement et les allocations spéciales se soldent par 0,80 \$ de dépenses additionnelles en R\&D pour chaque dollar d'impôts auquel renonce le gouvernement. Si la production économique augmente, les dépenses supplémentaires au titre de la recherche et du développement dépassent les coûts encourus par le gouvernement. En outre, le crédit fiscal pour immobilisations industrielles est un incitatif indirect qui provoque une augmentation des dépenses de R\&D pouvant atteindre environ 10 pour cent de l'augmentation obtenue per les incitations directes. /// Industrial performance is influenced by the rate of investment in research and development (R\&D). Western developed countries, and Canada in particular, have attempted to stimulate industrial R\&D expenditures through the use of tax incentives. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effects of both direct and indirect tax incentives on R\&D expenditures. The results are based on an econometric study of production and investment of Canadian firms. The results show that when there is no growth in the economy the R\&D investment tax credit and special allowance generate about \$.80 of additional R\&D expenditures per dollar of foregone tax revenues to the government. When ouput expands, the additional R\&D expenditures increase by more than the dollar cost to the government. In addition, the business fixed investment tax credit is an indirect incentive which causes R\&D expenditures to increase by about 10 per cent of the increase obtained for the direct incentives.},

We hope that this introductory essay and the three papers that follow will stimulate interest in this subject. This introductory essay first describes some of the basic economic tradeoffs involved in intellectual property law, and then describes the framework of the law in the six areas described above: patent, copyright, semiconductor protection, trademark, trade secret, and misappropriation. It is intended both to provide thumbnail descriptions of the various intellectual property regimes to economists working in this area and to indicate where additional economic research might be useful.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses how to improve Canada’s business innovation in order to boost labour productivity and output growth. Many general framework conditions are highly favourable to business risk-taking and innovation, including macro stability, openness, strong human capital, low corporate tax rates, low barriers to firm entry and flexible labour markets. However, they can be improved further by reduced external and interprovincial barriers in network and professional service sectors, more efficient capital markets, fewer capital tax distortions and improved patent protection. A second focus should be on ensuring that incentives arising from government subsidies are targeted on actual market failures. The very high level of support to business R\&amp;D via the federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR\&amp;ED) tax credit and provincial top-ups may affect the incentives of small firms to grow and should be redesigned. A plethora of small, fragmented granting programmes, mainly geared to SMEs, should be streamlined for better government-business collaboration. The large public share in venture capital should be wound down, as it may crowd out more productive private finance. A final focus should be on boosting manager and worker skills that are intrinsic to all forms of innovation, by filling gaps in training, mentoring and education. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD Economic Review of Canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Canada).},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades many European governments have pursued ambitious research and development (R\&D) policies with the aim of fostering innovation and economic growth in peripheral regions of Europe. The question is whether these policies are paying off. Arguments such as the need to reach a minimum threshold of research, the existence of important distance decay effects in the diffusion of technological spillovers, the presence of increasing returns to scale in R\&D investments, or the unavailability of the necessary socio-economic conditions in these regions to generate innovation seem to cast doubts about the possible returns of these sort of policies. This paper addresses this question. A two-step analysis is used in order to first identify the impact of R\&D investment of the private, public, and higher education sectors on innovation (measured as the number of patent applications per million population). The influence of innovation and innovation growth on economic growth is then addressed. The results indicate that R\&D investment, as a whole, and higher education R\&D investment in peripheral regions of the EU, in particular, are positively associated with innovation. The existence and strength of this association are, however, contingent upon region-specific socio-economic characteristics, which affect the capacity of each region to transform R\&D investment into innovation and, eventually, innovation into economic growth.},

While patenting feeds into market values immediately it appears to have a slower effect on productivity. This generates valuable real options because patents provide exclusive rights to develop new innovations, enabling firms to delay investments. Higher market uncertainty, which increases the value of real options, reduces the impact of new patents on productivity. If the government's policy to reduce uncertainty is successful then this should increase the productivity of Britain's knowledge capital.},

  abstract = {Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like ‘what to do if there is choice-based sampling?’ or ‘when to measure effects?’ can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.},

We investigate the average effect of R\&D tax credits on a series of innovation indicators such as: number of new products, sales with new products, originality of innovation, etc. using a non-parametric matching approach. Compared to a hypothetical situation in the absence of R\&D tax credits, recipients of tax credits show significantly better scores on most but not all performance indicators. We therefore conclude that tax credits lead to additional innovation output.},

This paper shows that these allegations are unfounded. The promise of the patent has a long history in Canadian and British patent law, and one that possesses sound policy justifications. Equally, promises are recognized and enforced under various guises by the patent law of the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the European Patent Office. The paper concludes by examining some of the open issues and unanswered questions that exist in courts’ approach to promises contained in patents.},

Respondents were surveyed at the beginning and end of 2011, which allows the comparison of ex ante and ex post reported use of the extra income. While workers on average intended to spend 14 percent of their tax cut income, they ex post reported spending 36 percent of the funds. This pattern of higher spending ex post is shared across all demographic groups. Differences across workers in this shift to greater ex post spending are largely unexplained by differences in either present bias or unanticipated shocks, so in the end the upward revision in spending remains a puzzle.},

  abstract = {Around 1974-75, output growth and associated productivity measures dropped sharply in the United States and in most other western industrialized nations and continued at rather low rates for most of the rest of the 1970s. During the late 1960s, the growth in research and development (R\&D) investment slowed down markedly (in constant dollars) and did not really recover until the late 1970s. Basic research was especially hard hit, showing a substantial absolute decline during the same period. Whether this slowdown in the investment in new technologies can account for the observed productivity slowdown is a fascinating question. I shall argue below that it cannot, at least not yet, since its effects take a long time to work themselves through the innovation and diffusion processes. The oil price hikes of the early and late 1970s and their macro-consequences are, therefore, the most likely direct causes of these pervasive declines in the growth rate of productivity.},

To do this, I exploit an exogenous reform in UK R\&D tax policy, which changed the definition of an SME from firms with fewer than 250 employees to those with fewer than 500 employees. I use the UK Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD), for which companies do not have an incentive to relabel their ordinary employees or spending as R\&D. I find that R\&D tax incentives help to increase R\&D spending at the company level; this translates to a user cost elasticity between −0.88 and −1.18. Further, the additional R\&D generated through the tax relief can be attributed entirely to an increase in the number of R\&D employees in the companies’ workforce. Together, these results challenge a common narrative on the role of R\&D tax incentives.},

The principal source of information used in this endeavour is the Statistics Canada Survey of Innovation 1999. The paper starts with an overview of other studies that looked at the use of intellectual property rights in Canada. Follows a conceptual framework presenting variables likely to explain the use specific IPRs by Canadian manufacturing firms. The use of IPRs is to a great extent correlated with basic economic characteristics of firms, their activities and industry environment. A series of estimated logit regressions predict the probability that a firm will use a specific IPR instrument. Also estimated is the contribution of the use of IPRs to the probability that a firm innovates. The decision of a firm to use IPRs is often not independent of the decision to innovate. To eliminate the potential endogeneity bias I estimate a two-stage logit model. A comparison of the single- and two-stage logit models shows that the nexus from the protection of intellectual property (patents) to innovation may be weaker than indicated by the single equation model.},

  abstract = {The last 50\,years has seen a dramatic decline in taxes on the rich across the advanced democracies. There is still fervent debate in both political and academic circles, however, about the economic consequences of this sweeping change in tax policy. This article contributes to this debate by utilizing a newly constructed indicator of taxes on the rich to identify all instances of major tax reductions on the rich in 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1965 and 2015. We then estimate the average effects of these major tax reforms on key macroeconomic aggregates. We find tax cuts for the rich lead to higher income inequality in both the short- and medium-term. In contrast, such reforms do not have any significant effect on economic growth or unemployment. Our results therefore provide strong evidence against the influential political–economic idea that tax cuts for the rich ‘trickle down’ to boost the wider economy.},

Calibrating the model, we find that the decentralized economy typically underinvests in R\&D relative to what is socially optimal.

Firms undertaking the R\&D can reduce production costs and introduce new products that provide benefits to consumers that are not fully captured in selling prices. Further, it is very difficult for R\&D-performing firms to prevent some of the knowledge created from leaking out or spilling over to other firms. Since firms do not take these positive spillover benefits into consideration when making investment decisions, most governments subsidize business investment in R\&D with the expectation that economic performance will improve as a result. Our study confirms the existence of substantial spillover benefits from R\&D performed in Canada, so government support for R\&D is justified. However, we do not find any empirical evidence to support the current policy of subsidizing R\&D at a higher rate when it is performed by small firms than when it is performed by large firms. We also find much lower private rate of return on R\&D performed by small firms than by large firms. Subsidies appear to be playing a key role in this result.},

Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in tax holidays, in addition to the well-known competition over the corporate income tax rate. We find no evidence, however, for competition over investment allowances and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower corporate income tax rates and longer tax holidays are effective in attracting FDI, but not in boosting gross private fixed capital formation or growth.},

  abstract = {Innovation is critical in the knowledge-based economy. It is generally accepted that governments have an important role to play in promoting innovative activity and R\&amp;D. Both the federal and provincial governments in Canada provide tax subsidies, and other forms of support, for R\&amp;D. Changes to various programs offered by the federal government were introduced in Budget 2012, most particularly related to the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR\&amp;ED) tax credit program. This paper analyzes the state of tax subsidies for R\&amp;D both pre- and post-budget, and at both the federal and provincial level. It is shown that there is a patchwork of effective tax subsidy rates in Canada, which vary both between and within provinces, between small versus large firms, and across sectors and types of R\&amp;D activity. The result is a misallocation of R\&amp;D resources and a system of government support that is less effective than it could be. On some dimensions Budget 2012 was a move in the right direction, but on other dimensions matters were made worse, resulting in a reconfiguration of tax support across R\&amp;D activities that is more distortionary and less efficient. Most particularly, the post-budget tax system heavily favours small firms over large firms, and labour intensive R\&amp;D over capital intensive R\&amp;D. This paper offers a lucid examination of R\&amp;D tax support pre- and post-budget, and argues persuasively that Canadian governments should adopt a more uniform, less distortionary approach to tax subsidies for R\&amp;D if they are truly interested in setting innovation free.},

Although Kenney is understandably concerned about the chilling effect Ottawa has had on energy investment, government is ill-suited for corporate management. To offset harmful federal policies, it would be wiser and more efficient to use targeted tax breaks and regulatory relief at the provincial level.In response to the recent abandonment of a \$20 billion oilsands project, in his speech {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/business/energy/do-what-is-necessary-kenney-hints-at-investment-in-major-oil-and-gas-project"{$>$}Kenney reminded listeners{$<$}/a{$>$} of the Alberta Energy Company (AEC), a Crown investment firm that ({$<$}a href="https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/hrcorpreports/pdfs/A/Alberta\_Energy\_Co\_Ltd\_1977.pdf"{$>$}by 1975{$<$}/a{$>$}) was owned 50/50 between public shareholders and the province of Alberta. The AEC was spearheaded by then-premier Peter Lougheed {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/sept-18-1973-green-light-for-syncrude-biggest-project-in-alberta-history"{$>$}who reportedly{$<$}/a{$>$} didn’t believe his support for (partial) government ownership in an energy company was “a denial of his free enterprise philosophy.”For Kenney’s part, he too argues that if the province of Alberta were to revive the legacy of “an agency or corporation similar to the AEC in the 1970s,” that this would merely be to offset the uncertain regulations “and frankly hostile policy-setting from Ottawa.”Kenney’s worries are completely legitimate: Besides the federal carbon tax, federal {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E\&amp;billId=9630600"{$>$}Bill C-69{$<$}/a{$>$} and {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=8936657\&amp;Language=E"{$>$}Bill C-48{$<$}/a{$>$}, passed into law last year, present real barriers to energy development in western Canada, through a tightened (but more political and uncertain) environmental review process and a restriction on large oil tankers’ ability to take exports from the British Columbia coast. Tighter federal standards on methane and ethanol are other examples of Ottawa’s “hostile” policy.Although these policies were justified by concerns over climate change, Premier Kenney is right that these federal moves have hindered energy development. This is economically damaging because it makes electricity and transportation more expensive for consumers, and also negatively impacts the workers who would have been hired in new development projects but are now not needed.Even so, the proposal to have the Alberta government itself invest in energy projects (or to give backstop guarantees to private investors) is a very blunt instrument, which might end up causing Albertan taxpayers a double whammy. If federal policies cause private investors to pull out of an energy project in Alberta, it’s because they think that Ottawa’s decisions have made the project not worth the risk.If now the provincial government effectively forces taxpayers to invest in the project, that decision doesn’t magically render the project a good risk after all. It merely means that taxpayers are implicitly having their money sunk into a project that professional investors have decided isn’t worth it.Rather than the government becoming a hedge fund, it would make more sense to engage in targeted tax and regulatory relief. For example, Alberta could waive any provincial-level taxes—including an {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/reforming-capital-gains-taxes-in-alberta"{$>$}offset to the federal capital gains tax{$<$}/a{$>$}—for those companies deemed to have been unduly harmed by Ottawa. This would still “invest” the forfeited potential tax revenue, while retain the advantages of private investors making business decisions with their own funds on the line. The province could continue the {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/evaluating-albertas-energy-regulator"{$>$}reform of the Alberta Energy Regulator{$<$}/a{$>$} so that developers can be certain of the rules.Premier Kenney is right to want to offset harmful Ottawa policies, but provincial ownership of energy companies is a dubious proposal. It would be wiser and more efficient to target tax and regulatory relief to offset federal burdens.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the impact of the U.S. federal R\&D tax credit between 1981–1991 using confidential IRS data from corporate tax returns. The empirical analysis makes two key advances on previous work. First, it implements a new instrumental variables (IV) strategy based on tax changes that directly addresses the simultaneity of R\&D spending and marginal credit rates. Second, the analysis makes use of new restricted-access IRS corporate return data describing R\&D expenditures. Estimates imply that a10\% reduction in the user cost of R\&D leads the average firm to increase its research intensity—the ratio of R\&D spending to sales—by 19.8\% in the short-run. Long-run estimates imply that the average firm faces adjustment costs and increases spending over time, though small and young firms show evidence of reversing initial increases. Analysis of the components of qualified research shows that wages and supplies account for the bulk of the increase in research spending. Elasticities of qualified and total research intensities from a smaller sample suggest firms respond to user cost changes largely by increasing their qualified spending, meaning that the type of R\&D the federal credit deems qualified research is an important margin on which the credit affects firm behavior.},

Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.},

These effects appear stronger in credit-constrained firms.

This increase to the minimum wage was the first in nearly a decade and was approved with the objective of alleviating poverty among low-income households. However, a higher minimum wage may result in more unemployment and poverty. We exploit time-series variation in minimum wages set by Canadian provinces between 1981 and 2004. OLS and IV results suggest that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3\%–5\% drop in teen employment. Further, a 10\% rise in the minimum wage is also significantly associated with a 4\%–6\% increase in the percentage of families living under Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs). Difference-in-difference estimates from the 1993, 1995, and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) support these findings as they suggest that income earned by teens constitutes a non-trivial portion of household income for families beneath Low Income Cut Offs. Therefore, a higher minimum wage may paradoxically result in a significant negative shock to household income among low-income families.},

  abstract = {This essay describes and evaluates state and local business tax incentives in the United States. In 2014, states spent between 5 USD and 216 USD per capita on incentives  for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. States with higher  per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology,  and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is 178M USD for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are  richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing winning and runner-up locations  for each deal, we find that average employment within the three-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs. While we find some evidence of direct  employment gains from attracting a firm, we do not find strong evidence that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader economic growth at the state and local level.},

Based on the strong public statements of economists opposing and supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a causal observer might wonder whether this law was tax reform or mere confusion. In this paper, I address that question and, more importantly, offer an assessment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The law is clearly not "tax reform" as economists usually use that term: that is, it does not seek to broaden the tax base and reduce marginal rates in a roughly revenue-neutral manner. However, the law is not just a muddle. It seeks to address some widely acknowledged issues with corporate taxation, and takes some steps toward broadening the tax base, in part by reducing the incentive to itemize deductions.},

  abstract = {To estimate the dynamic effects of an absorbing treatment, researchers often use two-way fixed effects regressions that include leads and lags of the treatment. We show that in settings with variation in treatment timing across units, the coefficient on a given lead or lag can be contaminated by effects from other periods, and apparent pretrends can arise solely from treatment effects heterogeneity. We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the relative shortcomings of two-way fixed effects regressions with leads and lags through an empirical application.},

  abstract = {Governments can provide targeted R\&D subsidies and/or tax incentives to spur innovation and growth in the business sector. This chapter analyzes the theoretical pros and cons of these policy instruments and their practical implications according to the empirical literature. Tax incentives have low administrative costs, enable market agents to choose R\&D projects, and can be provided to many firms. However, they entail the risk that governments might finance R\&D that would have been undertaken anyway (deadweight loss) and that firms may relabel other costs as R\&D costs. Targeted subsidies are preferable for projects with high uncertainty and those that require a long time to achieve a finished product and for contexts in which the government wishes to allocate resources to specific sectors. However, such subsidies have high bureaucratic costs, distort competition, and favor grant application experts. The greatest disadvantages of targeted R\&D subsidies are that they are mainly allocated to large firms and are often used as covert industrial subsidies.},

  abstract = {Extant literature, while often suggesting a positive link between green innovation and firm performance, is inconclusive. Moreover, the possibly moderating role of management has not been sufficiently considered. Using a unique dataset sampling 188 manufacturing firms in China, we examine how managerial concern (for green issues) moderates the relationship between green innovation and firm performance. We find that green process innovation and green product innovation both significantly (positively) predict firm performance, when not considering managerial concern for the environment. Once managerial concern is included, we observe that it compounds the positive effect of green process innovation on firm performance – but not product innovation, which no longer explains significant unique variance in firm performance. The findings hold various implications for future research and business policy. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

  abstract = {Using the findings of the 1999 Survey of Innovation in the Canadian manufacturing sector, we analyse the impediments, i.e. the problems and obstacles, that firms in the sector face when they innovate. In particular, we assess the factors which inhibit innovation, especially with regard to by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). First we try to establish the relationship between the impediments to innovation and various firm characteristics. Then we assess whether these impediments actually prevent firms from innovating or whether firms are able to overcome them. We find that the perception of impediments to innovation vary according to firm characteristics. For example, large firms are more likely to report the high cost of developing innovation and organizational rigidities as impediments than small firms. However, they seem to have less difficulty with regard to financing innovation projects compared to SMEs. Our results also show that firms seem to be able to overcome most of the obstacles to innovation. Therefore, the impediments featured in innovation survey(s) should not be interpreted as impenetrable barriers that prevent innovation. The sole exception is organizational rigidities. Firms facing organizational rigidities are less likely to become innovative, whether they are small, medium, or large. From our results, we conclude that small firms do not face particular impediments which prevent them from becoming innovative.},

Yet, there has been little research on the consequences and contingent mechanisms of non-R\&D innovation for firms embedded in collaborative network environments. To address this research gap, we investigated a conceptual framework of non-R\&D innovation using data drawn from Chinese manufacturing firms. First, we found that non-R\&D innovation positively affects firms’ new product performance. Second, we discovered that high R\&D intensity positively strengthens the impact of firms’ non-R\&D innovation on new product performance. Third, we provided critical analysis of the role of non-R\&D innovation in promoting new product performance, accomplished by enhancing R\&D investment while simultaneously improving the degree of network embeddedness. Our findings extend both the non-R\&D innovation literature and open innovation literature while providing managers with several key recommendations.},

  abstract = {Vehicle taxes and purchase subsidies have been used frequently to provide incentives for electric vehicle adoption. To examine the role of the incentives in reducing total ownership costs of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), increasing BEV sales, and obtaining environmental benefits from switching to BEVs, we carry out cost–benefit analyses and ordinary least square regressions. We study 10 pairs of BEVs and their internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) counterparts across 28 European countries from 2012 to 2014. The results show that, under the incentive schemes, the costs reduced by switching to large BEVs from their ICEV counterparts are larger than the costs reduced by switching to small BEVs from their ICEV counterparts. Owing to the cost-reduction effect, a 10\% increase of the total tax incentive leads to an increase in the sales share of BEVs by around 3\% on average. Finally, we find that it is still costly to use the tax incentives to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental externalities through transport electrification, despite recent improvements in greening electricity generation and lowering battery costs.},

Using Canadian panel data for 1988-90, I compare estimates based on the traditional U.S. methodology with those based on samples of "low-wage" workers exclusively. The results would appear to vindicate the critics: The minimum wage effect from the latter approach is virtually zero. Yet, estimates from different subgroups of low-wage workers indicate that there is a significant disemployment effect for those with longer low-wage employment histories. This highlights the heterogeneity within low-wage workers and the importance of carefully defining the target group not solely based on workers' wages.},
