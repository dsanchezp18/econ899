  abstract = {On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the most sweeping revision of US tax law since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The law introduced many  significant changes. However, perhaps none was as important as the changes in the treatment of traditional "C" corporations---those corporations subject to a separate corporate income tax.  Beginning in 2018, the federal corporate tax rate fell from 35 percent to 21 percent, some investment qualified for immediate deduction as an expense, and multinational corporations faced a  substantially modified treatment of their activities. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to understand its effects on resource allocation and distribution. It  compares US corporate tax rates to other countries before the 2017 tax law, and describes ways in which the US corporate sector has evolved that are especially relevant to tax policy. The  discussion then turns the main changes of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for the corporate income tax. A range of estimates suggests that the law is likely to contribute to increased US capital  investment and, through that, an increase in US wages. The magnitude of these increases is extremely difficult to predict. Indeed, the public debate about the benefits of the new corporate tax  provisions enacted (and the alternatives not adopted) has highlighted the limitations of standard approaches in distributional analysis to assigning corporate tax burdens.},

This paper shows that these allegations are unfounded. The promise of the patent has a long history in Canadian and British patent law, and one that possesses sound policy justifications. Equally, promises are recognized and enforced under various guises by the patent law of the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the European Patent Office. The paper concludes by examining some of the open issues and unanswered questions that exist in courts' approach to promises contained in patents.},

During the late 1960s, the growth in research and development (R\&D) investment slowed down markedly (in constant dollars) and did not really recover until the late 1970s. Basic research was especially hard hit, showing a substantial absolute decline during the same period. Whether this slowdown in the investment in new technologies can account for the observed productivity slowdown is a fascinating question. I shall argue below that it cannot, at least not yet, since its effects take a long time to work themselves through the innovation and diffusion processes. The oil price hikes of the early and late 1970s and their macro-consequences are, therefore, the most likely direct causes of these pervasive declines in the growth rate of productivity.},

To do this, I exploit an exogenous reform in UK R\&D tax policy, which changed the definition of an SME from firms with fewer than 250 employees to those with fewer than 500 employees. I use the UK Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD), for which companies do not have an incentive to relabel their ordinary employees or spending as R\&D. I find that R\&D tax incentives help to increase R\&D spending at the company level; this translates to a user cost elasticity between -0.88 and -1.18. Further, the additional R\&D generated through the tax relief can be attributed entirely to an increase in the number of R\&D employees in the companies' workforce. Together, these results challenge a common narrative on the role of R\&D tax incentives.},

The principal source of information used in this endeavour is the Statistics Canada Survey of Innovation 1999. The paper starts with an overview of other studies that looked at the use of intellectual property rights in Canada. Follows a conceptual framework presenting variables likely to explain the use specific IPRs by Canadian manufacturing firms. The use of IPRs is to a great extent correlated with basic economic characteristics of firms, their activities and industry environment. A series of estimated logit regressions predict the probability that a firm will use a specific IPR instrument. Also estimated is the contribution of the use of IPRs to the probability that a firm innovates. The decision of a firm to use IPRs is often not independent of the decision to innovate. To eliminate the potential endogeneity bias I estimate a two-stage logit model. A comparison of the single- and two-stage logit models shows that the nexus from the protection of intellectual property (patents) to innovation may be weaker than indicated by the single equation model.},

Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in tax holidays, in addition to the well-known competition over the corporate income tax rate. We find no evidence, however, for competition over investment allowances and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower corporate income tax rates and longer tax holidays are effective in attracting FDI, but not in boosting gross private fixed capital formation or growth.},

The survey results, the econometric results, and some simple calculations based on rough measures of the price elasticity of demand for R\&D all suggest that the special research allowance increased R\&D expenditures by about 1 percent and that the investment tax credit increased them by about 2 percent. These increases seem to be appreciably less than the revenue losses to the government.}

  abstract = {In a {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/business/energy/do-what-is-necessary-kenney-hints-at-investment-in-major-oil-and-gas-project"{$>$}recent speech{$<$}/a{$>$}, before the COVID-19 crisis exploded, Premier Jason Kenney hinted that the Alberta government might take an ownership stake in future oil and gas development. Although Kenney is understandably concerned about the chilling effect Ottawa has had on energy investment, government is ill-suited for corporate management. To offset harmful federal policies, it would be wiser and more efficient to use targeted tax breaks and regulatory relief at the provincial level.In response to the recent abandonment of a \$20 billion oilsands project, in his speech {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/business/energy/do-what-is-necessary-kenney-hints-at-investment-in-major-oil-and-gas-project"{$>$}Kenney reminded listeners{$<$}/a{$>$} of the Alberta Energy Company (AEC), a Crown investment firm that ({$<$}a href="https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/hrcorpreports/pdfs/A/Alberta\_Energy\_Co\_Ltd\_1977.pdf"{$>$}by 1975{$<$}/a{$>$}) was owned 50/50 between public shareholders and the province of Alberta. The AEC was spearheaded by then-premier Peter Lougheed {$<$}a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/sept-18-1973-green-light-for-syncrude-biggest-project-in-alberta-history"{$>$}who reportedly{$<$}/a{$>$} didn't believe his support for (partial) government ownership in an energy company was ``a denial of his free enterprise philosophy.''For Kenney's part, he too argues that if the province of Alberta were to revive the legacy of ``an agency or corporation similar to the AEC in the 1970s,'' that this would merely be to offset the uncertain regulations ``and frankly hostile policy-setting from Ottawa.''Kenney's worries are completely legitimate: Besides the federal carbon tax, federal {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E\&amp;billId=9630600"{$>$}Bill C-69{$<$}/a{$>$} and {$<$}a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=8936657\&amp;Language=E"{$>$}Bill C-48{$<$}/a{$>$}, passed into law last year, present real barriers to energy development in western Canada, through a tightened (but more political and uncertain) environmental review process and a restriction on large oil tankers' ability to take exports from the British Columbia coast. Tighter federal standards on methane and ethanol are other examples of Ottawa's ``hostile'' policy.Although these policies were justified by concerns over climate change, Premier Kenney is right that these federal moves have hindered energy development. This is economically damaging because it makes electricity and transportation more expensive for consumers, and also negatively impacts the workers who would have been hired in new development projects but are now not needed.Even so, the proposal to have the Alberta government itself invest in energy projects (or to give backstop guarantees to private investors) is a very blunt instrument, which might end up causing Albertan taxpayers a double whammy. If federal policies cause private investors to pull out of an energy project in Alberta, it's because they think that Ottawa's decisions have made the project not worth the risk.If now the provincial government effectively forces taxpayers to invest in the project, that decision doesn't magically render the project a good risk after all. It merely means that taxpayers are implicitly having their money sunk into a project that professional investors have decided isn't worth it.Rather than the government becoming a hedge fund, it would make more sense to engage in targeted tax and regulatory relief. For example, Alberta could waive any provincial-level taxes---including an {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/reforming-capital-gains-taxes-in-alberta"{$>$}offset to the federal capital gains tax{$<$}/a{$>$}---for those companies deemed to have been unduly harmed by Ottawa. This would still ``invest'' the forfeited potential tax revenue, while retain the advantages of private investors making business decisions with their own funds on the line. The province could continue the {$<$}a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/evaluating-albertas-energy-regulator"{$>$}reform of the Alberta Energy Regulator{$<$}/a{$>$} so that developers can be certain of the rules.Premier Kenney is right to want to offset harmful Ottawa policies, but provincial ownership of energy companies is a dubious proposal. It would be wiser and more efficient to target tax and regulatory relief to offset federal burdens.},

A standard model of heterogenous producers, amended to include a channel for innovation, is calibrated to the U.S. to serve as a benchmark. Canadian specific features that affect innovation spending, namely tax/subsidy policy, regulatory burden and innovation costs are applied to this benchmark, together and in isolation, to quantify their importance. When applied together, the model replicates many aspects of the Canadian economy and predicts lower innovation spending, average firm size and productivity, closely in line with the evidence. Differences in innovation costs account for the majority of firm size and productivity differences, while fairly modest differences in regulatory burden translate to sizeable aggregate losses because they alter incentives to innovate. Subsidies to innovation have subdued effects due to higher innovation costs and regulatory burden, but imply larger productivity differences if absent.},

This increase to the minimum wage was the first in nearly a decade and was approved with the objective of alleviating poverty among low-income households. However, a higher minimum wage may result in more unemployment and poverty. We exploit time-series variation in minimum wages set by Canadian provinces between 1981 and 2004. OLS and IV results suggest that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3\%--5\% drop in teen employment. Further, a 10\% rise in the minimum wage is also significantly associated with a 4\%--6\% increase in the percentage of families living under Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs). Difference-in-difference estimates from the 1993, 1995, and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) support these findings as they suggest that income earned by teens constitutes a non-trivial portion of household income for families beneath Low Income Cut Offs. Therefore, a higher minimum wage may paradoxically result in a significant negative shock to household income among low-income families.},

In 2014, states spent between 5 USD and 216 USD per capita on incentives  for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. States with higher  per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology,  and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is 178M USD for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are  richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing winning and runner-up locations  for each deal, we find that average employment within the three-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs. While we find some evidence of direct  employment gains from attracting a firm, we do not find strong evidence that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader economic growth at the state and local level.},

In particular, we assess the factors which inhibit innovation, especially with regard to by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). First we try to establish the relationship between the impediments to innovation and various firm characteristics. Then we assess whether these impediments actually prevent firms from innovating or whether firms are able to overcome them. We find that the perception of impediments to innovation vary according to firm characteristics. For example, large firms are more likely to report the high cost of developing innovation and organizational rigidities as impediments than small firms. However, they seem to have less difficulty with regard to financing innovation projects compared to SMEs. Our results also show that firms seem to be able to overcome most of the obstacles to innovation. Therefore, the impediments featured in innovation survey(s) should not be interpreted as impenetrable barriers that prevent innovation. The sole exception is organizational rigidities. Firms facing organizational rigidities are less likely to become innovative, whether they are small, medium, or large. From our results, we conclude that small firms do not face particular impediments which prevent them from becoming innovative.},

To examine the role of the incentives in reducing total ownership costs of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), increasing BEV sales, and obtaining environmental benefits from switching to BEVs, we carry out cost--benefit analyses and ordinary least square regressions. We study 10 pairs of BEVs and their internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) counterparts across 28 European countries from 2012 to 2014. The results show that, under the incentive schemes, the costs reduced by switching to large BEVs from their ICEV counterparts are larger than the costs reduced by switching to small BEVs from their ICEV counterparts. Owing to the cost-reduction effect, a 10\% increase of the total tax incentive leads to an increase in the sales share of BEVs by around 3\% on average. Finally, we find that it is still costly to use the tax incentives to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental externalities through transport electrification, despite recent improvements in greening electricity generation and lowering battery costs.},

  abstract = {Previous U.S. panel estimates of minimum wage effects have been criticized on the grounds that their identification rests on comparisons of "low-wage" and "high-wage" workers. Using Canadian panel data for 1988-90, I compare estimates based on the traditional U.S. methodology with those based on samples of "low-wage" workers exclusively. The results would appear to vindicate the critics: The minimum wage effect from the latter approach is virtually zero. Yet, estimates from different subgroups of low-wage workers indicate that there is a significant disemployment effect for those with longer low-wage employment histories. This highlights the heterogeneity within low-wage workers and the importance of carefully defining the target group not solely based on workers' wages.},
