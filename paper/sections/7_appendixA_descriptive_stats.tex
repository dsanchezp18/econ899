            \item \textit{Notes}: Calculations based on a balanced panel of $N$ = 656 province-monthly observations from 2001Q1 to 2021Q2. The sample includes all Canadian provinces except NL, PE, YU and NU. The treatment group is Alberta, and the control group consists of all remaining provinces. Post-intervention periods are those after 2017Q1.

Data from Statistics Canada were extracted using the \textit{statcanR} R package.
